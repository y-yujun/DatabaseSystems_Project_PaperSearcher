## Project Summary

This is a summary of the project!
We plan to build a web application to serve as a research paper database similar to Google Scholar and JSTOR. It allows users to search for papers and save papers to read later. Each paper will have attributes such as an ID, title, abstract, and published year. Each author will have attributes such as an ID, name, papers, and affiliations. The project aims to improve the search experience for research papers and facilitate academic research by incorporating new features such as advanced searching and note taking.
