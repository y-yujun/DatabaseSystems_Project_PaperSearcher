In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.','1993-08-01T00:00:00Z');

WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.','1993-08-01T00:00:00Z');
INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/9309101v1','An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT','We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT''s search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.','1993-09-01T00:00:00Z');
INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/9311101v1','The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut','As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.','1993-11-01T00:00:00Z');

We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.','1993-12-01T00:00:00Z');

We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.','1994-01-01T00:00:00Z');

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/9408101v1','Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy','Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods.','1994-08-01T00:00:00Z');

Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential.

These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented.

The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates.

In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph''s root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm''s completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.','1995-01-01T00:00:00Z');

Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility.

This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the "best" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies.

It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning.

In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.','1995-07-01T00:00:00Z');

In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems.','1995-08-01T00:00:00Z');

Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network''s cycle-cutset.','1995-10-01T00:00:00Z');

Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.','1995-11-01T00:00:00Z');

Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.','1995-12-01T00:00:00Z');

This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known.

Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative'' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally'' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis.

Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods.

These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.','1996-09-01T00:00:00Z');

Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.','1996-09-01T00:00:00Z');

We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents'' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents'' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents'' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one ''strict'', the other ''tolerant'', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes.','1996-10-01T00:00:00Z');

This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP.','1996-11-01T00:00:00Z');

A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'''', ``sum'''' or ``max'''', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence.

While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN''s architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.','1997-01-01T00:00:00Z');

Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.','1997-03-01T00:00:00Z');

Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.','1997-05-01T00:00:00Z');

We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead.

Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents'' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus''s partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team''s and individual members'' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions.

However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare.

DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems.

The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion.

We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.','1998-03-01T00:00:00Z');

The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable'' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms.','1998-03-01T00:00:00Z');

We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.','1998-05-01T00:00:00Z');

Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.','1998-06-01T00:00:00Z');

This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon''s notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence.

Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent''s state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'''' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute.

For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics.

However, these algorithms are not complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment, if one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs.','2000-02-04T12:53:57Z');

At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax.

Results indicate that the encodings and Smodels are quite competitive: they outperform state-of-the-art SAT-checkers working with an optimized encoding of DES into SAT and are comparable with a SAT-checker that is customized and tuned for the optimized SAT encoding.','2000-03-08T21:49:57Z');

We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories.','2000-03-09T08:58:15Z');

The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known.','2000-03-09T22:30:27Z');

Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'''' represents the revised state; alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.   The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A.','2000-03-11T06:29:02Z');

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0003077v1','DATALOG with constraints - an answer-set programming system','Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and combinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints. However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming.

This theory is distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition and hepatitis prognosis prediction.','2001-05-11T14:17:42Z');

In p-d terms an argument is good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text.

An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels.

Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\cal AT}^{0}, {\cal AT}^{1} and {\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\cal A} language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action languages.','2002-06-03T06:20:21Z');

There are obvious analogies between open predicates and abducible predicates. However, despite superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly, open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming (ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and ASP.','2002-07-07T09:55:00Z');

The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains.

This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology. Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole "unprogrammed" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal representations of some nontrivial parts of brain''s performance. (In the same way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The "curse of dimensionality" that plagues purely phenomenological ("brainless") cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent insufficiently large parts of brain''s performance in a state space of insufficiently high dimensionality.

To speed up learning, one often used solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton''s Dyna algorithm, or various other methods using macro-actions.   Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal. In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations.','2002-12-10T22:15:25Z');

Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models. Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case. Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine.

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0305019v1','On rho in a Decision-Theoretic Apparatus of Dempster-Shafer Theory','Thomas M. Strat has developed a decision-theoretic apparatus for Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J. Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest expected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals. This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus, an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is justifiable.','2003-05-16T15:07:09Z');
INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0305044v2','Updating beliefs with incomplete observations','Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions. This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations, when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.','2003-05-27T11:05:52Z');
INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0306124v1','Updating Probabilities','As examples such as the Monty Hall puzzle show, applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a ``naive space'''', which does not take into account the protocol used, can often lead to counterintuitive results. Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'''') in the statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'''' conditioning in a naive space works. We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on CAR and MRE.','2003-06-23T22:24:05Z');

An inherent difficulty in solving configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator.

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0307056v1','From Statistical Knowledge Bases to Degrees of Belief','An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other non-deductive reasoning systems.','2003-07-24T21:32:09Z');

This approach relies mainly on the closed world assumption to complete the available knowledge and its formulation has its basis in the so-called Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation.   The primary goal of this work is to present an alternative and epistemic-based characterization of stable model semantics, to the Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation. In particular, we show that stable model semantics can be defined entirely as an extension of the Kripke-Kleene semantics. Indeed, we show that the closed world assumption can be seen as an additional source of `falsehood'' to be added cumulatively to the Kripke-Kleene semantics.

We mainly focus on the first part. It consists of a variable domain value ranking based on reduced costs. Exploiting the ranking, we generate, in a Limited Discrepancy Search tree, the most promising subproblems first. An interesting result is that reduced costs provide a very precise ranking that allows to almost always find the optimal solution in the first generated subproblem, even if its dimension is significantly smaller than that of the original problem. Concerning the proof of optimality, we exploit a way to increase the lower bound for subproblems at higher discrepancies. We show experimental results on the TSP and its time constrained variant to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but the technique could be generalized for other problems.','2004-07-16T14:53:21Z');

PCR1 and WAO are particular cases of WO (the Weighted Operator) because the conflicting mass is redistributed with respect to some weighting factors. In this first PCR rule, the proportionalization is done for each non-empty set with respect to the non-zero sum of its corresponding mass matrix - instead of its mass column average as in WAO, but the results are the same as Ph. Smets has pointed out. Also, we extend WAO (which herein gives no solution) for the degenerate case when all column sums of all non-empty sets are zero, and then the conflicting mass is transferred to the non-empty disjunctive form of all non-empty sets together; but if this disjunctive form happens to be empty, then one considers an open world (i.e. the frame of discernment might contain new hypotheses) and thus all conflicting mass is transferred to the empty set. In addition to WAO, we propose a general formula for PCR1 (WAO for non-degenerate cases).','2004-08-03T16:08:37Z');

We argue that these forms can simplify the study of program properties, mainly consistency. The first normal form, called the {\em kernel} of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets. The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is possible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed. The second normal form is called {\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in 3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to a cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have positive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static analysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of existence of answer sets.

In this paper we devise an algorithm to populate the CPT while easing the extent of knowledge acquisition.

These are elicited from the domain expert. The set of probabilities are obtained by taking into consideration the heuristics that experts use while arriving at probabilistic estimations.

Apart from the tracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either to steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator about the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality measure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated observations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could be the Kullback-Leibler difference.   We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some terrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and "meta-sensors" with force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different size. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle filters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their sub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of those sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.   Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior PHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to three or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a mapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on doctrine knowledge of unit configuration.   The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using some measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a bounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a discretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the measure locally to different parts of the space.','2004-11-19T13:12:40Z');

The pre-processing step associates reports to known tracks (or initializes new tracks for reports on objects that have not been seen before). It could also be used as a pre-process step before clustering, e.g., in order to test how many clusters to use.   The pre-processing is done by solving an approximate version of the original problem. In this approximation, not all pair-wise conflicts are calculated. The approximation relies on knowing how many such pair-wise conflicts that are necessary to compute.

Many NP-complete problems can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical "guess and check" nature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond NP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. While these problems also have a clear "guess and check" structure, finding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a non-obvious task, in particular if the "check" itself is a coNP-complete problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check program. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free (extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended) disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence, and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a designated answer set of the transformed program.

The interpretability of classification models can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models. The required diversity of the DT ensemble can be achieved by using the Bayesian model averaging all possible DTs.

For sampling large DTs, the MCMC method is extended by Reversible Jump technique which allows inducing DTs under given priors.

Several modifications of ATNoSFERES are proposed here: the most important one conceptually being a representational change: each token is now represented by an integer, hence the genotype is a string of integers; several other modifications of the underlying grammar language are also proposed. The resulting ATNoSFERES-II is validated on several standard animat Non Markov problems, on which it outperforms all previously published results in the LCS literature.

It is an extension of the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with synergistic rules, fulfilling the $\epsilon$-completeness property and providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution.

To find the complete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with branching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the so-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for solving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that uses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection search. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions are isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums of solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper, we propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants, which not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case, but also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These new search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the construction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our experiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by one order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of solutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the solutions are isolated.','2005-12-11T19:47:42Z');

Whereas reasoning with general programs in OASP is undecidable, the FPL translation of (loosely) guarded programs falls in the decidable (loosely) guarded fixed point logic (mu(L)GF). Moreover, we reduce normal closed ASP to loosely guarded OASP, enabling for the first time, a characterization of an answer set semantics by muLGF formulas.

In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources (prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and furthermore combine it with possible user preferences.

In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability of FDESs. (3) Some examples serving to illuminate the applications of the diagnosability of FDESs are described.

One way to guarantee reliability is the use of robust design styles, e.g., delay-insensitivity. For early timing evaluation two aspects must be considered: a) The timing needs to be proportional to technology variations and b) the implemented architecture should be identical for prototype and target. The first can be met also by delay-insensitive implementation. The latter one is the key point. A unified architecture is needed for prototyping as well as implementation. Our new approach to rapid prototyping of signal processing tasks is based on a configurable, delay-insensitive implemented processor called Flysig. In essence, the Flysig processor can be understood as a complex FPGA where the CLBs are substituted by bit-serial operators. In this paper the general concept is detailed and first experimental results are given for demonstration of the main advantages: delay-insensitive design style, direct correspondence between prototyping and target architecture, high performance and reasonable shortening of the design cycle.','1998-10-12T10:11:05Z');

Of particular note is the requirement that all critical features be flanked by opposite-phase shifters, while the shifters obey minimum width and spacing requirements. A layout is called phase-assignable if it satisfies this requirement. If a layout is not phase-assignable, the phase conflicts have to removed to enable the use of AAPSM for the layout. Previous work has sought to detect a suitable set of phase Conflicts to be removed, as well as correct them. The contribution of this paper are the following: (1) a new approach to detect a minimal set of phase conflicts (also referred to as AAPSM conflicts), which when corrected will produce a phase-assignable layout; (2) a novel layout modification scheme for correcting these AAPSM conflicts. The proposed approach for conflict detection shows significant improvements in the quality of results and runtime for real industrial circuits, when compared to previous methods.

The proposed approach recovers the available slack at non-worst-case operating points through more aggressive voltage scaling and tracks changing conditions by monitoring the error recovery rate. Voltage margins needed in traditional designs to accommodate worst-case performance conditions are therefore eliminated, resulting in a significant improvement in energy efficiency. The approach was implemented for a 6mm memory read bus operating at 1.5GHz (0.13 $\mu$m technology node) and was simulated for a number of benchmark programs. Even at the worst-case process and environment conditions, energy gains of up to 17% are achieved, with error recovery rates under 2.3%.

The pruning algorithm is based on a novel theory of perturbation bounds which are shown to decrease as they propagate through the circuit. This allows pruning of gate sensitivities without complete propagation of their perturbations. We apply our proposed optimization algorithm to ISCAS benchmark circuits and demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Since the benefits from MIMO result in a heavy computational load in detectors, the design of low-complexity sub-optimum receivers is currently an active area of research. Lattice-reduction-aided detection (LRAD) has been shown to be an effective low-complexity method with near-ML performance. In this paper we advocate the use of systolic array architectures for MIMO receivers, and in particular we exhibit one of them based on LRAD. The "LLL lattice reduction algorithm" and the ensuing linear detections or successive spatial-interference cancellations can be located in the same array, which is con- siderably hardware-efficient. Since the conventional form of the LLL algorithm is not immediately suitable for parallel processing, two modified LLL algorithms are considered here for the systolic array. LLL algorithm with full-size reduction (FSR-LLL) is one of the versions more suitable for parallel processing. Another variant is the all-swap lattice-reduction (ASLR) algorithm for complex-valued lattices, which processes all lattice basis vectors simultaneously within one iteration. Our novel systolic array can operate both algorithms with different external logic controls. In order to simplify the systolic array design, we replace the Lov\''asz condition in the definition of LLL-reduced lattice with the looser Siegel condition. Simulation results show that for LR- aided linear detections, the bit-error-rate performance is still maintained with this relaxation. Comparisons between the two algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate performance, and average FPGA processing time in the systolic array are made, which shows that ASLR is a better choice for a systolic architecture, especially for systems with a large number of antennas.','2011-01-17T18:09:52Z');

The iterative decoding algorithms required for these codes involve high computational complexity and high processing throughput is achieved by allocating a sufficient number of processing elements (PEs). Supporting multiple heterogeneous LDPC codes on a parallel decoder poses serious problems in the design of the interconnect structure for such PEs. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of NoC (Network on Chip) based decoders, where full flexibility in terms of supported LDPC codes is obtained resorting to an NoC to connect PEs. NoC based LDPC decoders have been previously considered unfeasible because of the cost overhead associated to packet management and routing. On the contrary, the designed NoC adopts a low complexity routing, which introduces a very limited cost overhead with respect to architectures dedicated to specific classes of codes. Moreover the paper proposes an efficient configuration technique, which allows for fast on--the--fly switching among different codes. The decoder architecture is scalable and VLSI synthesis results are presented for several cases of study, including the whole set of WiMAX LDPC codes, WiFi codes and DVB-S2 standard.','2011-05-13T07:17:16Z');

While lowering the operational voltage can reduce power consumption, there are limits imposed at design time, beyond which hardware components experience faulty operation. Moreover, the decrease in feature size has led to higher susceptibility to process variations, leading to reliability issues and lowering yield. However, not all computations and all data in a workload need to maintain 100% fidelity. In this paper, we explore the idea of employing functional or storage units that let go the conservative guardbands imposed on the design to guarantee reliable execution. Rather, these units exhibit Elastic Fidelity, by judiciously lowering the voltage to trade-off reliable execution for power consumption based on the error guarantees required by the executing code. By estimating the accuracy required by each computational segment of a workload, and steering each computation to different functional and storage units, Elastic Fidelity Computing obtains power and energy savings while reaching the reliability targets required by each computational segment.

Decoding algorithms that exchange binary messages are interesting for fully-parallel implementations because they can reduce the number and the length of the wires, and increase logic density. This paper introduces the Relaxed Half-Stochastic (RHS) decoding algorithm, a binary message belief propagation (BP) algorithm that achieves a coding gain comparable to the best known BP algorithms that use real-valued messages. We derive the RHS algorithm by starting from the well-known Sum-Product algorithm, and then derive a low-complexity version suitable for circuit implementation.

Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch divergence. This leaves designers with two choices: use a small warps and invest in finding new solutions to enhance coalescing or use large warps and address branch divergence employing effective control-flow solutions. In this work our goal is to investigate the answer to this question. We analyze warp size impact on memory coalescing and branch divergence. We use our findings to study two machines: a GPU using small warps but equipped with excellent memory coalescing (SW+) and a GPU using large warps but employing an MIMD engine immune from control-flow costs (LW+).

To detect transient faults, previous core-level schemes provide redundancy for each core separately. As a result, they may leave transient faults in the uncore parts, which consume over 50% area of a modern CMP, escaped from detection. This paper proposes RepTFD, the first core-level transient fault detection scheme with 100% coverage. Instead of providing redundancy for each core separately, RepTFD provides redundancy for a group of cores as a whole. To be specific, it replays the execution of the checked group of cores on a redundant group of cores. Through comparing the execution results between the two groups of cores, all malignant transient faults can be caught. Moreover, RepTFD adopts a novel pending period based record-replay approach, which can greatly reduce the number of execution orders that need to be enforced in the replay-run. Hence, RepTFD brings only 4.76% performance overhead in comparison to the normal execution without fault-tolerance according to our experiments on the RTL design of an industrial CMP named Godson-3.

Consequently, the directory not only consumes large chip area, but also incurs considerable energy consumption and performance degradation, due to the large number of Invalidation/Ack messages transferred in the interconnection network and resulting network congestion. In this paper, we reveal the interesting fact that the directory is actually an unnecessary luxury for practical parallel systems. Because of widely deployed software/hardware techniques involving instruction reordering, most (if not all) parallel systems work under the weak consistency model, where a remote store instruction is allowed to be invisible to a core before the next synchronization of the core, instead of being made visible eagerly by invalidating PC backups of other cores. Based on this key observation, we propose a lightweight novel scheme called {\em DLS (DirectoryLess Shared last-level cache)}, which completely removes the directory and Invalidation/Ack messages, and efficiently maintains cache coherence using a novel {\em self-suspicion + speculative execution} mechanism. Experimental results over SPLASH-2 benchmarks show that on a 16-core processor, DLS not only completely removes the chip area cost of the directory, but also improves processor performance by 11.08%, reduces overall network traffic by 28.83%, and reduces energy consumption of the network by 15.65% on average (compared with traditional MESI protocol with full directory).

Small warps reduce the performance penalty associated with branch and memory divergence at the expense of a reduction in memory coalescing. Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch and memory divergence. Dynamic workload behavior, including branch/memory divergence and coalescing, is an important factor in determining the warp size returning best performance. Optimal warp size can vary from one workload to another or from one program phase to the next. Based on this observation, we propose Dynamic Warp Resizing (DWR).

NAND flash memories are becoming the most important storage media in mobile computing and tend to be less confined to this area. The major constraint of such a technology is the limited number of possible erase operations per block which tend to quickly provoke memory wear out. To cope with this issue, state-of-the-art solutions implement wear leveling policies to level the wear out of the memory and so increase its lifetime. These policies are integrated into the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) and greatly contribute in decreasing the write performance. In this paper, we propose to reduce the flash memory wear out problem and improve its performance by absorbing the erase operations throughout a dual cache system replacing FTL wear leveling and garbage collection services. We justify this idea by proposing a first performance evaluation of an exclusively cache based system for embedded flash memories.

We investigate the effect of code alignment in six SoCs and find that a large proportion of this energy (up to 15% of total SoC energy consumption) can be saved by changes to the alignment.   A flexible model is created to predict the read-access energy consumption of flash memory on deeply embedded SoCs, where code is executed in place. This model uses the instruction level memory accesses performed by the processor to calculate the flash energy consumption of a sequence of instructions. We derive the model parameters for five SoCs and validate them. The error is as low as 5%, with a 11% average normalized RMS deviation overall.   The scope for using this model to optimize code alignment is explored across a range of benchmarks and SoCs. Analysis shows that over 30% of loops can be better aligned.

The paper describes the main structural elements of the machine, the high-level architecture, and the dataflow between components. The computer could perform the four basic arithmetic operations using floating-point numbers. Instructions were read from punched tape. A program consisted of a sequence of arithmetical operations, intermixed with memory store and load instructions, interrupted possibly by input and output operations. Numbers were stored in a mechanical memory. The machine did not include conditional branching in the instruction set. While the architecture of the Z1 is similar to the relay computer Zuse finished in 1941 (the Z3) there are some significant differences. The Z1 implements operations as sequences of microinstructions, as in the Z3, but does not use rotary switches as micro-steppers. The Z1 uses a digital incrementer and a set of conditions which are translated into microinstructions for the exponent and mantissa units, as well as for the memory blocks. Microinstructions select one out of 12 layers in a machine with a 3D mechanical structure of binary mechanical elements. The exception circuits for mantissa zero, necessary for normalized floating-point, were lacking; they were first implemented in the Z3. The information for this article was extracted from careful study of the blueprints drawn by Zuse for the reconstruction of the Z1 for the German Technology Museum in Berlin, from some letters, and from sketches in notebooks.

We describe a control-flow mechanism which provides dynamic loop-pipelining capability in hardware, so that multiple iterations of an arbitrary inner loop can be made simultaneously active in the generated hardware, We study the impact of this loop-pipelining scheme in conjunction with source-level loop-unrolling. In particular, we apply this technique to some common loop kernels: regular kernels such as the fast-fourier transform and matrix multiplication, as well as an example of an inner loop whose body has branching. The resulting resulting hardware descriptions are synthesized to an FPGA target, and then characterized for performance and resource utilization. We observe that the use of dynamic loop-pipelining mechanism alone typically results in a significant improvements in the performance of the hardware. If the loop is statically unrolled and if loop-pipelining is applied to the unrolled program, then the performance improvement is still substantial. When dynamic loop pipelining is used in conjunction with static loop unrolling, the improvement in performance ranges from 6X to 20X (in terms of number of clock cycles needed for the computation) across the loop kernels that we have studied.

We found that although programmer specific instructions show some impact on the similarity measures, they are much smaller and therefore insignificant compared to the impact from application specific programs.','2014-12-24T15:35:44Z');

It is a challenge for virtualization technology architects to enhance the security of VMs without degrading their performance. Currently available server machines are not fully equipped to support a secure VM environment without compromising on performance. A few hardware modifications have been introduced by manufactures like Intel and AMD to provide a secure VM environment with low performance degradation. In this paper we propose a novel memory architecture model named \textit{ Architectural Support for Memory Isolation(ASMI)}, that can achieve a true isolated physical memory region to each VM without degrading performance.

Since the allocation of threads to an SM is at the thread block granularity, some of the resources may not be used up completely and hence will be wasted.   We propose an approach that shares the resources of SM to utilize the wasted resources by launching more thread blocks. We show the effectiveness of our approach for two resources: register sharing, and scratchpad (shared memory) sharing. We further propose optimizations to hide long execution latencies, thus reducing the number of stall cycles. We implemented our approach in GPGPU-Sim simulator and experimentally validated it on several applications from 4 different benchmark suites: GPGPU-Sim, Rodinia, CUDA-SDK, and Parboil.

While PCM achieves low energy due to various technology-specific advantages, PCM is significantly slower than DRAM (especially for writes) and can endure far fewer writes before wearing out. Previous work has proposed to use a large, DRAM-based hardware cache to absorb writes and provide faster access. However, due to ineffectual caching where blocks are evicted before sufficient number of accesses, hardware caches incur significant overheads in energy and bandwidth, two key but scarce resources in modern multicores. Because using hardware for detecting and removing such ineffectual caching would incur additional hardware cost and complexity, we leverage the OS virtual memory support for this purpose. We propose a DRAM-PCM hybrid memory architecture where the OS migrates pages on demand from the PCM to DRAM. We call the DRAM part of our memory as MigrantStore which includes two ideas. First, to reduce the energy, bandwidth, and wear overhead of ineffectual migrations, we propose migration hysteresis. Second, to reduce the software overhead of good replacement policies, we propose recently- accessed-page-id (RAPid) buffer, a hardware buffer to track the addresses of recently-accessed MigrantStore pages.','2015-04-16T16:36:14Z');

DRAM reads a whole row simultaneously from the cell array to a row buffer, but can transfer only a fraction of the data from the row buffer to peripheral IO circuit, through a limited and expensive set of wires referred to as global bitlines. In presence of wider memory channels, the major bottleneck becomes the limited data transfer capacity through these global bitlines. Our goal in this work is to enable higher bandwidth in 3D-stacked DRAM without the increased cost of adding more global bitlines. We instead exploit otherwise-idle resources, such as global bitlines, already existing within the multiple DRAM layers by accessing the layers simultaneously. Our architecture, Simultaneous Multi Layer Access (SMLA), provides higher bandwidth by aggregating the internal bandwidth of multiple layers and transferring the available data at a higher IO frequency.   To implement SMLA, simultaneous data transfer from multiple layers through the same IO TSVs requires coordination between layers to avoid channel conflict. We first study coordination by static partitioning, which we call Dedicated-IO, that assigns groups of TSVs to each layer. We then provide a simple, yet sophisticated mechanism, called Cascaded-IO, which enables simultaneous access to each layer by time-multiplexing the IOs. By operating at a frequency proportional to the number of layers, SMLA provides a higher bandwidth (4X for a four-layer stacked DRAM). Our evaluations show that SMLA provides significant performance improvement and energy reduction (55%/18% on average for multi-programmed workloads, respectively) over a baseline 3D-stacked DRAM with very low area overhead.','2015-06-10T04:14:29Z');

In this paper, we devise the first mechanism, called UBM (page Utility Based hybrid Memory management), that systematically estimates the system performance benefit of placing a page in DRAM versus NVM and uses this estimate to guide data placement. UBM''s estimation method consists of two major components. First, it estimates how much an application''s stall time can be reduced if the accessed page is placed in DRAM. To do this, UBM comprehensively considers access frequency, row buffer locality, and memory level parallelism (MLP) to estimate the application''s stall time reduction. Second, UBM estimates how much each application''s stall time reduction contributes to overall system performance. Based on this estimation method, UBM can determine and place the most critical data in DRAM to directly optimize system performance.

The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) aided successive cancelation list (SCL) decoding algorithm has better error performance than the SC algorithm. However, current CRC aided SCL (CA-SCL) decoders still suffer from long decoding latency and limited throughput. In this paper, a reduced latency list decoding (RLLD) algorithm for polar codes is proposed. Our RLLD algorithm performs the list decoding on a binary tree, whose leaves correspond to the bits of a polar code. In existing SCL decoding algorithms, all the nodes in the tree are traversed and all possibilities of the information bits are considered. Instead, our RLLD algorithm visits much fewer nodes in the tree and considers fewer possibilities of the information bits. When configured properly, our RLLD algorithm significantly reduces the decoding latency and hence improves throughput, while introducing little performance degradation.

The circuit uses a delay locked loop (DLL) to generate multiple phases of the clock, of which the one closest to the center of the eye is picked by a phase detector loop. The picked phase is then further fine tuned by an analog voltage controlled delay to position the sampling clock at the center of the eye. A clock domain transfer circuit then transfers the sampled data to the receiver clock domain with a maximum latency of three clock cycles. The proposed synchronizer has been designed and fabricated in 130 nm UMC MM CMOS technology. The circuit consumes 1.4 mW from a 1.2 V supply at a data rate of 1.3 Gbps. Further, the proposed synchronizer has been designed and simulated in TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology.

For this purpose, all flits in the network received extra bits, such that every flit carries routing information. The routers use this extra information to perform arbitration and schedule the flits to the corresponding output ports.

Security attacks targeting embedded systems illegally gain access to the information in these devices or destroy information. The two most common types of attacks embedded systems encounter are code-injection and power analysis attacks. In the past, a number of countermeasures, both hardware- and software-based, were proposed individually against these two types of attacks. However, no single system exists to counter both of these two prominent attacks in a processor based embedded system. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, proposes a hardware/software based countermeasure against both code-injection attacks and power analysis based side-channel attacks in a dual core embedded system. The proposed processor, named SecureD, has an area overhead of just 3.80% and an average runtime increase of 20.0% when compared to a standard dual processing system. The overhead were measured using a set of industry standard application benchmarks, with two encryption and five other programs.','2015-11-05T23:00:13Z');

When these interconnects are used in large scale and high volume digital systems their testability becomes very important. This paper discusses the testability of low swing repeaterless on-chip interconnects with equalization and clock synchronization. A capacitively coupled transmitter with a weak driver is used as the transmitter. The receiver samples the low swing input data at the center of the data eye and converts it to rail to rail levels and also synchronizes the data to the receiver''s clock domain. The system is a mixed signal circuit and the digital components are all scan testable. For the analog section, just a DC test has a fault coverage of 50% of the structural faults. Simple techniques allow integration of the analog components into the digital scan chain increasing the coverage to 74%. Finally, a BIST with low overhead enhances the coverage to 95% of the structural faults. The design and simulations have been done in UMC 130 nm CMOS technology.','2015-11-20T19:10:00Z');

Tardis also incurs extra network traffic on some benchmarks due to renew messages, and has suboptimal performance when the program uses spinning to communicate between threads.   In this paper, we address these downsides of Tardis protocol and make it significantly more practical.

Digital LDOs (DLDO) can offer low voltage operation, faster transient response, and higher current efficiency. Response time as well as output voltage ripple can be reduced by increasing the speed of the dynamic comparators. However, the comparator offset steeply increases for high clock frequencies, thereby leading to enhanced variations in output voltage. In this work we explore the design of digital LDOs with multiple dynamic comparators that can overcome this bottleneck. In the proposed topology, we apply time-interleaved comparators with the same voltage threshold and uniform current step in order to accomplish the aforementioned features. Simulation based analysis shows that the DLDO with time-interleaved comparators can achieve better overall performance in terms of current efficiency, ripple and settling time. For a load step of 50mA, a DLDO with 8 time-interleaved comparators could achieve an output ripple of less than 5mV, while achieving a settling time of less than 0.5us.

This is also referred to as cross-layer resilience. In this paper, we focus on radiation-induced soft errors in processor cores. We address both single-event upsets (SEUs) and single-event multiple upsets (SEMUs) in terrestrial environments. Our framework automatically and systematically explores the large space of comprehensive resilience techniques and their combinations across various layers of the system stack (586 cross-layer combinations in this paper), derives cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at minimal costs, and provides guidelines for the design of new resilience techniques. We demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of our framework using two diverse designs: a simple, in-order processor core and a complex, out-of-order processor core. Our results demonstrate that a carefully optimized combination of circuit-level hardening, logic-level parity checking, and micro-architectural recovery provides a highly cost-effective soft error resilience solution for general-purpose processor cores. For example, a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate is achieved at only 2.1% energy cost for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an in-order core) with no speed impact. However, selective circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis of the effects of soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a cost-effective soft error resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional energy cost for a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate).','2016-04-11T18:44:27Z');

We show that the assumption of #P_1 being contained in FP implies P = BPP and that PH is contained in MOD_{k}P for each k \geq 2, which provides further evidence that not all sets in P have an easy census function. We also relate a set''s property of having an easy census function to other well-studied properties of sets, such as rankability and scalability (the closure of the rankable sets under P-isomorphisms). Finally, we prove that it is no more likely that the census function of any set in P can be approximated (more precisely, can be n^{\alpha}-enumerated in time n^{\beta} for fixed \alpha and \beta) than that it can be precisely computed in polynomial time.','1998-09-01T12:15:55Z');

It is well-known that if either of these hierarchies collapses at a given level, then all higher levels of that hierarchy collapse to that same level. This is a standard ``upward translation of equality'''' that has been known for over a decade. The issue of whether these hierarchies can translate equality {\em downwards\/} has proven vastly more challenging. In particular, with regard to the figure above, consider the following claim:   $$P_{m-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} = P_{m+1-tt}^{\Sigma_k^p} \implies   DIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) coDIFF_m(\Sigma_k^p) = BH(\Sigma_k^p). (*) $$   This claim, if true, says that equality translates downwards between levels of the bounded-query hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy levels that (before the fact) are immediately below them.   Until recently, it was not known whether (*) {\em ever\/} held, except for the degenerate cases $m=0$ and $k=0$. Then Hemaspaandra, Hemaspaandra, and Hempel \cite{hem-hem-hem:j:downward-translation} proved that (*) holds for all $m$, for $k > 2$. Buhrman and Fortnow~\cite{buh-for:j:two-queries} then showed that, when $k=2$, (*) holds for the case $m = 1$. In this paper, we prove that for the case $k=2$, (*) holds for all values of $m$. Since there is an oracle relative to which ``for $k=1$, (*) holds for all $m$'''' fails \cite{buh-for:j:two-queries}, our achievement of the $k=2$ case cannot to be strengthened to $k=1$ by any relativizable proof technique.

In general, if C is such a class, then every set X of languages has a dimension in C, which is a real number dim(X|C) in [0,1].

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0203017v1','The Dimensions of Individual Strings and Sequences','A constructive version of Hausdorff dimension is developed using constructive supergales, which are betting strategies that generalize the constructive supermartingales used in the theory of individual random sequences. This constructive dimension is used to assign every individual (infinite, binary) sequence S a dimension, which is a real number dim(S) in the interval [0,1]. Sequences that are random (in the sense of Martin-Lof) have dimension 1, while sequences that are decidable, \Sigma^0_1, or \Pi^0_1 have dimension 0. It is shown that for every \Delta^0_2-computable real number \alpha in [0,1] there is a \Delta^0_2 sequence S such that \dim(S) = \alpha.   A discrete version of constructive dimension is also developed using termgales, which are supergale-like functions that bet on the terminations of (finite, binary) strings as well as on their successive bits. This discrete dimension is used to assign each individual string w a dimension, which is a nonnegative real number dim(w). The dimension of a sequence is shown to be the limit infimum of the dimensions of its prefixes.   The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is proven to be the product of its length and its dimension. This gives a new characterization of algorithmic information and a new proof of Mayordomo''s recent theorem stating that the dimension of a sequence is the limit infimum of the average Kolmogorov complexity of its first n bits.

We first study a one-sided version of this bound and obtain that its value lies between the MA- and AM-complexities of the considered function. Hence the lower bound actually works for a (communication complexity) class between MA cap co-MA and AM cap co-AM. We also show that the MA-complexity of the disjointness problem is Omega(sqrt(n)). Following this we consider the conjecture that the lower bound method is polynomially tight for randomized communication complexity. First we disprove a distributional version of this conjecture. Then we give a combinatorial characterization of the value of the lower bound method, in which the optimization over all distributions is absent. This characterization is done by what we call a uniform threshold cover.

This problem arises when considering two competing salesmen instead of just one. The concern for a shortest tour is replaced by the necessity to reach any of the customers before the opponent does. In particular, we consider the situation where players take turns, moving along one edge at a time within a graph G=(V,E). The set of customers is given by a subset V_C V of the vertices. At any given time, both players know of their opponent''s position. A player wins if he is able to reach a majority of the vertices in V_C before the opponent does. We prove that the CSP is PSPACE-complete, even if the graph is bipartite, and both players start at distance 2 from each other. We show that the starting player may lose the game, even if both players start from the same vertex. For bipartite graphs, we show that the starting player always can avoid a loss.

Small span theorems have been proven for increasingly stronger polynomial-time reductions, and a small span theorem for polynomial-time Turing reductions would imply BPP != EXP. In contrast to the progress in resource-bounded measure, Ambos-Spies, Merkle, Reimann, and Stephan (2001) showed that there is no small span theorem for the resource-bounded dimension of Lutz (2000), even for polynomial-time many-one reductions.   Resource-bounded scaled dimension, recently introduced by Hitchcock, Lutz, and Mayordomo (2003), provides rescalings of resource-bounded dimension. We use scaled dimension to further understand the contrast between measure and dimension regarding polynomial-time spans and degrees. We strengthen prior results by showing that the small span theorem holds for polynomial-time many-one reductions in the -3rd-order scaled dimension, but fails to hold in the -2nd-order scaled dimension. Our results also hold in exponential space.   As an application, we show that determining the -2nd- or -1st-order scaled dimension in ESPACE of the many-one complete languages for E would yield a proof of P = BPP or P != PSPACE.

We first describe how any SAT formula can be associated with a novel family of Markov random fields (MRFs), parameterized by a real number \rho \in [0,1]. We then show that applying belief propagation--a well-known ``message-passing'''' technique for estimating marginal probabilities--to this family of MRFs recovers a known family of algorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (\rho = 1) to standard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over SAT assignments at the other extreme (\rho = 0). Configurations in these MRFs have a natural interpretation as partial satisfiability assignments, on which a partial order can be defined. We isolate cores as minimal elements in this partial ordering, which are also fixed points of survey propagation and the only assignments with positive probability in the MRF for \rho=1. Our experimental results for k=3 suggest that solutions of random formulas typically do not possess non-trivial cores. This makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial assignments for \rho<1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very close to being cores. To that end, we investigate the associated lattice structure, and prove a weight-preserving identity that shows how any MRF with \rho>0 can be viewed as a ``smoothed'''' version of the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments (\rho=0). Finally, we isolate properties of Gibbs sampling and message-passing algorithms that are typical for an ensemble of k-SAT problems.','2004-09-08T01:27:14Z');

This problem is NP-hard in general, and, therefore, it is natural to study how restricting the allowed types of constraints affects the approximability of the problem. It is known that every Boolean (that is, two-valued) Max CSP problem with a finite set of allowed constraint types is either solvable exactly in polynomial time or else APX-complete (and hence can have no polynomial time approximation scheme unless P=NP.

It seems plausible that the size of the smallest self-assembly program that builds a shape and the shape''s descriptional (Kolmogorov) complexity should be related. We show that when using a notion of a shape that is independent of scale, this is indeed so: in the Tile Assembly Model, the minimal number of distinct tile types necessary to self-assemble a shape, at some scale, can be bounded both above and below in terms of the shape''s Kolmogorov complexity. As part of the proof of the main result, we sketch a general method for converting a program outputting a shape as a list of locations into a set of tile types that self-assembles into a scaled up version of that shape. Our result implies, somewhat counter-intuitively, that self-assembly of a scaled-up version of a shape often requires fewer tile types. Furthermore, the independence of scale in self-assembly theory appears to play the same crucial role as the independence of running time in the theory of computability. This leads to an elegant formulation of languages of shapes generated by self-assembly. Considering functions from integers to shapes, we show that the running-time complexity, with respect to Turing machines, is polynomially equivalent to the scale complexity of the same function implemented via self-assembly by a finite set of tile types. Our results also hold for shapes defined by Wang tiling -- where there is no sense of a self-assembly process -- except that here time complexity must be measured with respect to non-deterministic Turing machines.','2004-12-21T10:30:46Z');

These are Turing reductions in which the sequence of query lengths is nonincreasing (nondecreasing). We ask whether these restrictions in fact limit the power of reductions. We prove that query-increasing and query-decreasing Turing reductions are incomparable with (that is, are neither strictly stronger than nor strictly weaker than) truth-table reductions and are strictly weaker than Turing reductions. In addition, we prove that query-nonincreasing and query-nondecreasing Turing reductions are strictly stronger than truth-table reductions and strictly weaker than Turing reductions. Despite the fact that we prove query-increasing and query-decreasing Turing reductions to in the general case be strictly weaker than Turing reductions, we identify a broad class of sets A for which any set that Turing reduces to A will also reduce to A via both query-increasing and query-decreasing Turing reductions.

To do this, we propose novel techniques for designing tile sets that permit an arbitrary length $m$ binary number to be encoded into a sequence of $O(m)$ temperature changes such that the tile set uniquely assembles a supertile that precisely encodes the corresponding binary number. As an application, we show how this provides a general tile set of size O(1) that is capable of uniquely assembling essentially any $n\times n$ square, where the assembled square is determined by a temperature sequence of length $O(\log n)$ that encodes a binary description of $n$. This yields an important decrease in tile complexity from the required $\Omega(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ for almost all $n$ when the temperature of the system is fixed. We further show that for almost all $n$, no tile system can simultaneously achieve both $o(\log n)$ temperature complexity and $o(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ tile complexity, showing that both versions of an optimal square building scheme have been discovered. This work suggests that temperature change can constitute a natural, dynamic method for providing input to self-assembly systems that is potentially superior to the current technique of designing large tile sets with specific inputs hardwired into the tileset.','2006-02-05T01:00:32Z');

Similarly, NST and RST, respectively, are used for the corresponding nondeterministic and randomized classes.

Our main results are (1) a trade-off between internal memory space and external memory head reversals, (2) correspondences between the (R,N)ST-classes and ``classical'''' time-bounded, space-bounded, reversal-bounded, and circuit complexity classes, and (3) hierarchies of (R)ST-classes in terms of increasing numbers of head reversals on external memory tapes.','2006-08-07T11:37:11Z');

If, in addition, $f(G)$ is a graph isomorphic to $G$, then $f$ is called a canonical form for graphs. Gurevich proves that graphs have a polynomial-time computable canonical form exactly when they have a polynomial-time computable complete invariant. We extend this equivalence to the polylogarithmic-time model of parallel computation for classes of graphs with bounded rigidity index and for classes of graphs with small separators. In particular, our results apply to three representative classes of graphs embeddable into a fixed surface, namely, to 5-connected graphs, to 3-connected graphs admitting a polyhedral embedding, and 3-connected graphs admitting a large-edge-width embedding. Another application covers graphs with bounded treewidth. Since in the latter case an NC complete-invariant algorithm is known, we conclude that graphs of bounded treewidth have a canonical form (and even a canonical labeling) computable in NC.','2006-08-18T09:46:09Z');

Singleton sets {f} (where f is Lp-computable) are meager, suitable infinite unions of meager sets are meager, and the whole space of Lp-computable functions is not meager. We give an alternative characterization of meager sets via Banach Mazur games.

We give an alternative characterization of small sets via resource-bounded Banach-Mazur games.   As an application of the first notion, we show that for almost every language A (i.e. all except a meager class) computable in subexponential time, P(A)=BPP(A). We also show that almost all languages in PSPACE do not have small nonuniform complexity.   We then switch to the second Baire category notion (called locally-computable), and show that the class SPARSE is meager in P. We show that in contrast to the resource-bounded measure case, meager-comeager laws can be obtained for many standard complexity classes, relative to locally-computable Baire category on BPP and PSPACE.   Another topic where locally-computable Baire categories differ from resource-bounded measure is regarding weak-completeness: we show that there is no weak-completeness notion in P based on locally-computable Baire categories, i.e. every P-weakly-complete set is complete for P. We also prove that the class of complete sets for P under Turing-logspace reductions is meager in P, if P is not equal to DSPACE(log n), and that the same holds unconditionally for quasi-poly time.   Finally we observe that locally-computable Baire categories are incomparable with all existing resource-bounded measure notions on small complexity classes, which might explain why those two settings seem to differ so fundamentally.','2006-09-05T09:02:11Z');

Recent work on heuristics, and the satisfiability threshold has centered around the structure and connectivity of the solution space. Motivated by this work, we study structural and connectivity-related properties of the space of solutions of Boolean satisfiability problems and establish various dichotomies in Schaefer''s framework.   On the structural side, we obtain dichotomies for the kinds of subgraphs of the hypercube that can be induced by the solutions of Boolean formulas, as well as for the diameter of the connected components of the solution space. On the computational side, we establish dichotomy theorems for the complexity of the connectivity and st-connectivity questions for the graph of solutions of Boolean formulas. Our results assert that the intractable side of the computational dichotomies is PSPACE-complete, while the tractable side - which includes but is not limited to all problems with polynomial time algorithms for satisfiability - is in P for the st-connectivity question, and in coNP for the connectivity question. The diameter of components can be exponential for the PSPACE-complete cases, whereas in all other cases it is linear; thus, small diameter and tractability of the connectivity problems are remarkably aligned. The crux of our results is an expressibility theorem showing that in the tractable cases, the subgraphs induced by the solution space possess certain good structural properties, whereas in the intractable cases, the subgraphs can be arbitrary.','2006-09-13T07:25:59Z');

Then, theorems of T_1 are shown to translate into families of propositional tautologies that have uniform polysize Frege proofs, T_1 is shown to prove the soundness of a particular Frege system F, and F is shown to provably p-simulate any proof system whose soundness can be proved in T_1. Finally, T_1 is compared with other theories for ALOGTIME reasoning in the literature.   To our knowledge, this is the first formal theory for ALOGTIME reasoning whose basic objects are strings instead of numbers, and the first quantifier-free theory formalizing ALOGTIME reasoning in which a direct proof of the soundness of some Frege system has been given (in the case of first-order theories, such a proof was first given by Arai for his theory AID). Also, the polysize Frege proofs we give for the propositional translations of theorems of T_1 are considerably simpler than those for other theories, and so is our proof of the soundness of a particular F-system in T_1. Together with the simplicity of T_1''s recursion schemes, axioms, and rules these facts suggest that T_1 is one of the most natural theories available for ALOGTIME reasoning.','2007-02-28T02:59:36Z');

When the condition $P$ completely specifies an empirical probability distribution $\pi$ over $\Sigma_m$, i.e., a limiting frequency of occurrence for {\em every} symbol in $\Sigma_m$, it has been known since 1949 that the Hausdorff dimension of $X$ is precisely $\CH(\pi)$, the Shannon entropy of $\pi$, and the finite-state dimension was proven to have this same value in 2001.   The saturated sets were studied by Volkmann and Cajar decades ago. It got attention again only with the recent developments in multifractal analysis by Barreira, Saussol, Schmeling, and separately Olsen. However, the powerful methods they used -- ergodic theory and multifractal analysis -- do not yield a value for the finite-state (or even computable) dimension in an obvious manner.   We give a pointwise characterization of finite-state dimensions of saturated sets. Simultaneously, we also show that their finite-state dimension and strong dimension coincide with their Hausdorff and packing dimension respectively, though the techniques we use are completely elementary.

We construct two quantum objects for this problem, which we call the nonstandard quantum group and nonstandard Hecke algebra. We show that the nonstandard quantum group has a compact real form and its representations are completely reducible, that the nonstandard Hecke algebra is semisimple, and that they satisfy an analog of quantum Schur-Weyl duality.   Using these nonstandard objects as a guide, we follow the approach of Adsul, Sohoni, and Subrahmanyam to construct, in the case dim(V) = dim(W) =2, a representation \check{X}_\nu of the nonstandard quantum group that specializes to Res_{GL(V) \times GL(W)} X_\nu at q=1.

We go on to develop the beginnings of a graphical calculus for this basis, along the lines of the U_q(\sl_2) graphical calculus, and use this to organize the crystal components of +HNSTC(\nu) into eight families.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results.

Self-organization processes of prime integer relations define correlation structures of a complex system and can be equivalently represented by transformations of two-dimensional geometrical patterns determining the dynamics of the system and revealing its structural complexity. Computational experiments raise the possibility of an optimality condition of complex systems presenting the structural complexity of a system as a key to its optimization.   From this perspective the optimization of a system could be all about the control of the structural complexity of the system to make it consistent with the structural complexity of the problem. The experiments also indicate that the performance of a complex system may behave as a concave function of the structural complexity. Therefore, once the structural complexity could be controlled as a single entity, the optimization of a complex system would be potentially reduced to a one-dimensional concave optimization irrespective of the number of variables involved its description.

Max CSP captures many well-known problems (such as Max k-SAT and Max Cut) and is consequently NP-hard. Thus, it is natural to study how restrictions on the allowed constraint types (or constraint languages) affect the complexity and approximability of Max CSP. The PCP theorem is equivalent to the existence of a constraint language for which Max CSP has a hard gap at location 1, i.e. it is NP-hard to distinguish between satisfiable instances and instances where at most some constant fraction of the constraints are satisfiable. All constraint languages, for which the CSP problem (i.e., the problem of deciding whether all constraints can be satisfied) is currently known to be NP-hard, have a certain algebraic property. We prove that any constraint language with this algebraic property makes Max CSP have a hard gap at location 1 which, in particular, implies that such problems cannot have a PTAS unless P = NP. We then apply this result to Max CSP restricted to a single constraint type; this class of problems contains, for instance, Max Cut and Max DiCut. Assuming P $\neq$ NP, we show that such problems do not admit PTAS except in some trivial cases. Our results hold even if the number of occurrences of each variable is bounded by a constant.

We present a generalization of the composition of weighted transducers, 3-way composition, which is dramatically faster in practice than the standard composition algorithm when combining more than two transducers. The worst-case complexity of our algorithm for composing three transducers $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ resulting in $T$, \ignore{depending on the strategy used, is $O(|T|_Q d(T_1) d(T_3) + |T|_E)$ or $(|T|_Q d(T_2) + |T|_E)$,} is $O(|T|_Q \min(d(T_1) d(T_3), d(T_2)) + |T|_E)$, where $|\cdot|_Q$ denotes the number of states, $|\cdot|_E$ the number of transitions, and $d(\cdot)$ the maximum out-degree. As in regular composition, the use of perfect hashing requires a pre-processing step with linear-time expected complexity in the size of the input transducers. In many cases, this approach significantly improves on the complexity of standard composition. Our algorithm also leads to a dramatically faster composition in practice. Furthermore, standard composition can be obtained as a special case of our algorithm. We report the results of several experiments demonstrating this improvement.

Then we use the same argument to prove similar results for prefix complexity (and also improve results of (Muchnik, 1987) about limit frequencies), a priori probability on binary tree and measure of effectively open sets. As a by-product, we get a criterion of $\mathbf{0''}$ Martin-L\"of randomness (called also 2-randomness) proved in (Miller, 2004): a sequence $\omega$ is 2-random if and only if there exists $c$ such that any prefix $x$ of $\omega$ is a prefix of some string $y$ such that $\KS(y)\ge |y|-c$. (In the 1960ies this property was suggested in (Kolmogorov, 1968) as one of possible randomness definitions; its equivalence to 2-randomness was shown in (Miller, 2004) while proving another 2-randomness criterion (see also (Nies et al. 2005)): $\omega$ is 2-random if and only if $\KS(x)\ge |x|-c$ for some $c$ and infinitely many prefixes $x$ of $\omega$.

We formalize the robustness of state probabilities to reaction rate deviations, and describe a formal connection between robustness and efficiency of simulation. Without robustness guarantees, stochastic simulation seems to require computational time proportional to the total number of reaction events. Even if the concentration (molecular count per volume) stays bounded, the number of reaction events can be linear in the duration of simulated time and total molecular count. We show that the behavior of robust systems can be predicted such that the computational work scales linearly with the duration of simulated time and concentration, and only polylogarithmically in the total molecular count. Thus our asymptotic analysis captures the dramatic speedup when molecular counts are large, and shows that for bounded concentrations the computation time is essentially invariant with molecular count. Finally, by noticing that even robust stochastic chemical reaction networks are capable of embedding complex computational problems, we argue that the linear dependence on simulated time and concentration is likely optimal.','2008-03-07T17:36:54Z');

On the other hand, polynomial identity testing is a well-studied algorithmic problem with efficient randomized algorithms and the problem of obtaining efficient \emph{deterministic} identity tests has received a lot of attention recently. The goal of this note is to compare the isolation lemma with polynomial identity testing: 1. We show that derandomizing reasonably restricted versions of the isolation lemma implies circuit size lower bounds. We derive the circuit lower bounds by examining the connection between the isolation lemma and polynomial identity testing. We give a randomized polynomial-time identity test for noncommutative circuits of polynomial degree based on the isolation lemma. Using this result, we show that derandomizing the isolation lemma implies noncommutative circuit size lower bounds. The restricted versions of the isolation lemma we consider are natural and would suffice for the standard applications of the isolation lemma. 2. From the result of Klivans-Spielman \cite{KS01} we observe that there is a randomized polynomial-time identity test for commutative circuits of polynomial degree, also based on a more general isolation lemma for linear forms. Consequently, derandomization of (a suitable version of) this isolation lemma also implies circuit size lower bounds in the commutative setting.','2008-04-07T04:04:21Z');

It is then possible to determine that the only deterministic optimization of a NP-complete problem that could prove P = NP would be one that examines no more than a polynomial number of input sets for a given problem.

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('0805.1385v3','Almost-natural proofs','Razborov and Rudich have shown that so-called "natural proofs" are not useful for separating P from NP unless hard pseudorandom number generators do not exist. This famous result is widely regarded as a serious barrier to proving strong lower bounds in circuit complexity theory.   By definition, a natural combinatorial property satisfies two conditions, constructivity and largeness. Our main result is that if the largeness condition is weakened slightly, then not only does the Razborov-Rudich proof break down, but such "almost-natural" (and useful) properties provably exist. Specifically, under the same pseudorandomness assumption that Razborov and Rudich make, a simple, explicit property that we call "discrimination" suffices to separate P/poly from NP; discrimination is nearly linear-time computable and almost large, having density 2^{-q(n)} where q is a quasi-polynomial function. For those who hope to separate P from NP using random function properties in some sense, discrimination is interesting, because it is constructive, yet may be thought of as a minor alteration of a property of a random function.   The proof relies heavily on the self-defeating character of natural proofs. Our proof technique also yields an unconditional result, namely that there exist almost-large and useful properties that are constructive, if we are allowed to call non-uniform low-complexity classes "constructive." We note, though, that this unconditional result can also be proved by a more conventional counting argument.   Finally, we give an alternative proof, communicated to us by Salil Vadhan at FOCS 2008, of one of our theorems, and we make some speculative remarks on the future prospects for proving strong circuit lower bounds.','2008-05-09T18:14:43Z');

This technique has two main drawbacks: it is difficult to compute, and it is not known to lower bound quantum communication complexity with entanglement.   Linial and Shraibman recently introduced a norm, called gamma_2^{alpha}, to quantum communication complexity, showing that it can be used to lower bound communication with entanglement. Here the parameter alpha is a measure of approximation which is related to the allowable error probability of the protocol. This bound can be written as a semidefinite program and gives bounds at least as large as many techniques in the literature, although it is smaller than the corresponding alpha-approximation rank, rk_alpha. We show that in fact log gamma_2^{alpha}(A)$ and log rk_{alpha}(A)$ agree up to small factors.

In fact, we show the formally stronger result that planar graph canonization is in logspace. This improves the previously known upper bound of AC1 [MillerReif''91].

This is achieved by using the above decomposition, and by making significant modifications to Lindell''s algorithm for tree canonization, along with changes in the space complexity analysis.

While there exist examples like Bin Packing, which does not admit any kernel unless P = NP, there apparently is a strong relation between these two polynomial-time techniques. We add to this picture by showing that the natural decision versions of all problems in two prominent classes of constant-factor approximable problems, namely MIN F^+\Pi_1 and MAX NP, admit polynomial problem kernels. Problems in MAX SNP, a subclass of MAX NP, are shown to admit kernels with a linear base set, e.g., the set of vertices of a graph. This extends results of Cai and Chen (JCSS 1997), stating that the standard parameterizations of problems in MAX SNP and MIN F^+\Pi_1 are fixed-parameter tractable, and complements recent research on problems that do not admit polynomial kernelizations (Bodlaender et al.

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('0906.1084v1','Physical portrayal of computational complexity','Computational complexity is examined using the principle of increasing entropy. To consider computation as a physical process from an initial instance to the final acceptance is motivated because many natural processes have been recognized to complete in non-polynomial time (NP). The irreversible process with three or more degrees of freedom is found intractable because, in terms of physics, flows of energy are inseparable from their driving forces. In computational terms, when solving problems in the class NP, decisions will affect subsequently available sets of decisions. The state space of a non-deterministic finite automaton is evolving due to the computation itself hence it cannot be efficiently contracted using a deterministic finite automaton that will arrive at a solution in super-polynomial time. The solution of the NP problem itself is verifiable in polynomial time (P) because the corresponding state is stationary. Likewise the class P set of states does not depend on computational history hence it can be efficiently contracted to the accepting state by a deterministic sequence of dissipative transformations. Thus it is concluded that the class P set of states is inherently smaller than the set of class NP. Since the computational time to contract a given set is proportional to dissipation, the computational complexity class P is a subset of NP.','2009-06-05T10:56:00Z');

The multiple temperature model is a natural generalization of Winfree''s abstract tile assembly model, where the temperature of a tile system is allowed to be shifted up and down as self-assembly proceeds. We first exhibit two constant-size tile sets in which scaled-up versions of arbitrary shapes self-assemble. Our first tile set has the property that each scaled shape self-assembles via an asymptotically "Kolmogorov-optimum" temperature sequence but the scaling factor grows with the size of the shape being assembled. In contrast, our second tile set assembles each scaled shape via a temperature sequence whose length is proportional to the number of points in the shape but the scaling factor is a constant independent of the shape being assembled. We then show that there is no constant-size tile set that can uniquely assemble an arbitrary (non-scaled, connected) shape in the multiple temperature model, i.e., the scaling is necessary for self-assembly.

The latter notion was introduced by Schnorr and is rather natural: an infinite binary sequence is computably random if no total computable strategy succeeds on it by betting on bits in order. However, computably random sequences can have properties that one may consider to be incompatible with being random, in particular, there are computably random sequences that are highly compressible. The concept of Martin-Loef randomness is much better behaved in this and other respects, on the other hand its definition in terms of martingales is considerably less natural. Muchnik, elaborating on ideas of Kolmogorov and Loveland, refined Schnorr''s model by also allowing non-monotonic strategies, i.e. strategies that do not bet on bits in order. The subsequent ``non-monotonic'''' notion of randomness, now called Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness, has been shown to be quite close to Martin-Loef randomness, but whether these two classes coincide remains a fundamental open question. As suggested by Miller and Nies, we study in this paper weak versions of Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness, where the betting strategies are non-adaptive (i.e., the positions of the bits to bet on should be decided before the game).

Here, we investigate how to formally treat knowledge possession by parties (with registered public-keys) interacting over the Internet. Stated more technically, we look into the relative power of the notion of ``concurrent knowledge-extraction'''' (CKE) in the concurrent zero-knowledge (CZK) bare public-key (BPK) model.','2009-08-18T01:43:21Z');

The main lower bound technique for the communication complexity of such problems is that of partition arguments: partition the k players into two disjoint sets of players and find a lower bound for the induced two-party communication complexity problem.   In this paper, we study the power of partition arguments. Our two main results are very different in nature: (i) For randomized communication complexity, we show that partition arguments may yield bounds that are exponentially far from the true communication complexity. Specifically, we prove that there exists a 3-argument function f whose communication complexity is Omega(n), while partition arguments can only yield an Omega(log n) lower bound. The same holds for nondeterministic communication complexity. (ii) For deterministic communication complexity, we prove that finding significant gaps between the true communication complexity and the best lower bound that can be obtained via partition arguments, would imply progress on a generalized version of the "log-rank conjecture" in communication complexity.

For our main construction, we prove that multiplicatively disjoint arithmetic circuits of size $n^{O(1)}$ and treewidth $k$ can be simulated by bounded fan-in arithmetic formulas of depth $O(k^2\log n)$. From this we derive the analogous statement for syntactically multilinear arithmetic circuits, which strengthens a theorem of Mahajan and Rao.

This solves an open problem due to Klivans (2002) and rules out the use of perceptron-based techniques for PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces, a central unresolved challenge in computational learning.

Our first result shows that every $n$-variable threshold function $f$ is $\eps$-close to a threshold function depending only on $\Inf(f)^2 \cdot \poly(1/\eps)$ many variables, where $\Inf(f)$ denotes the total influence or average sensitivity of $f.$ This is an exponential sharpening of Friedgut''s well-known theorem \cite{Friedgut:98}, which states that every Boolean function $f$ is $\eps$-close to a function depending only on $2^{O(\Inf(f)/\eps)}$ many variables, for the case of threshold functions. We complement this upper bound by showing that $\Omega(\Inf(f)^2 + 1/\epsilon^2)$ many variables are required for $\epsilon$-approximating threshold functions.   Our second result is a proof that every $n$-variable threshold function is $\eps$-close to a threshold function with integer weights at most $\poly(n) \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^{2/3})}.$ This is a significant improvement, in the dependence on the error parameter $\eps$, on an earlier result of \cite{Servedio:07cc} which gave a $\poly(n) \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(1/\eps^{2})}$ bound. Our improvement is obtained via a new proof technique that uses strong anti-concentration bounds from probability theory.

This implies we have a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for testing whether the sum of a constant number of RO-ABPs computes the zero polynomial.   2) Given black-box access to the RO-ABPs computing the individual polynomials in the sum, we get a deterministic algorithm that runs in time $k^2n^{O(\log n)} + n^{O(k)}$.   3) Finally, given only black-box access to the polynomial computed by the sum of the $k$ RO-ABPs, we obtain an $n^{O(k + \log n)}$ time deterministic algorithm.','2009-12-14T02:10:50Z');

For the reliable recovery of syntenic blocks, noise and ambiguities in the genomic maps need to be removed first. Maximal Strip Recovery (MSR) is an optimization problem proposed by Zheng, Zhu, and Sankoff for reliably recovering syntenic blocks from genomic maps in the midst of noise and ambiguities. Given $d$ genomic maps as sequences of gene markers, the objective of \msr{d} is to find $d$ subsequences, one subsequence of each genomic map, such that the total length of syntenic blocks in these subsequences is maximized. For any constant $d \ge 2$, a polynomial-time 2d-approximation for \msr{d} was previously known. In this paper, we show that for any $d \ge 2$, \msr{d} is APX-hard, even for the most basic version of the problem in which all gene markers are distinct and appear in positive orientation in each genomic map. Moreover, we provide the first explicit lower bounds on approximating \msr{d} for all $d \ge 2$. In particular, we show that \msr{d} is NP-hard to approximate within $\Omega(d/\log d)$. From the other direction, we show that the previous 2d-approximation for \msr{d} can be optimized into a polynomial-time algorithm even if $d$ is not a constant but is part of the input.

Our construction is reminiscent of the studies of \emph{intrinsic universality} of cellular automata by Ollinger and others, in the sense that our simulation of a tile system $T$ by a tile system $U$ represents each tile in an assembly produced by $T$ by a $c \times c$ block of tiles in $U$, where $c$ is a constant depending on $T$ but not on the size of the assembly $T$ produces (which may in fact be infinite).

Our first main result shows that a recent pseudorandom generator construction of Meka and Zuckerman [MZ09], when suitably modifed, can fool arbitrary functions of d halfspaces under product distributions where each coordinate has bounded fourth moment. To eps-fool any size-s, depth-d decision tree of halfspaces, our pseudorandom generator uses seed length O((d log(ds/eps)+log n) log(ds/eps)). For monotone functions of d halfspaces, the seed length can be improved to O((d log(d/eps)+log n) log(d/eps)). We get better bounds for larger eps; for example, to 1/polylog(n)-fool all monotone functions of (log n)= log log n halfspaces, our generator requires a seed of length just O(log n). Our second main result generalizes the work of Diakonikolas et al. [DGJ+09] to show that bounded independence suffices to fool functions of halfspaces under product distributions.

The verifier is only allowed to read a very small portion of the proof, and in return is allowed to err with some bounded probability. The probability that the verifier accepts a false proof is called the soundness error, and is an important parameter of a PCP system that one seeks to minimize. Constructing PCPs with sub-constant soundness error and, at the same time, a minimal number of queries into the proof (namely two) is especially important due to applications for inapproximability.   In this work we construct such PCP verifiers, i.e., PCPs that make only two queries and have sub-constant soundness error. Our construction can be viewed as a combinatorial alternative to the "manifold vs. point" construction, which is the only construction in the literature for this parameter range. The "manifold vs. point" PCP is based on a low degree test, while our construction is based on a direct product test. We also extend our construction to yield a decodable PCP (dPCP) with the same parameters. By plugging in this dPCP into the scheme of Dinur and Harsha (FOCS 2009) one gets an alternative construction of the result of Moshkovitz and Raz (FOCS 2008), namely: a construction of two-query PCPs with small soundness error and small alphabet size.

Each node obtains a value in [k] equal to its binary function applied to the values of its children, and the output is the value of the root. The first restricted computation model, called Fractional Pebbling, is a generalization of the black/white pebbling game on graphs, and arises in a natural way from the search for good upper bounds on the size of nondeterministic branching programs (BPs) solving the TEP - for any fixed h, if the binary tree of height h has fractional pebbling cost at most p, then there are nondeterministic BPs of size O(k^p) solving the height h TEP.

The unique feature of this Linear Program is that though there is no explicit bound on the minimum required number of linear inequalities, which is most probably exponential to the size of the NP-Complete problem, the Linear Program can still be described efficiently. The reason for this efficient description is that coefficients keep repeating in some pattern, even as the number of inequalities is conveniently assumed to tend to Infinity. I discuss why this convenient assumption does not change the feasibility result of the Linear Program. I conclude with two Conjectures, which might help to make an efficient decision on the feasibility of this Linear Program.','2010-03-05T13:02:18Z');

The first technique is the first known Monte Carlo algorithm with analytical error bounds suitable for pricing single-stock options with meaningful confidence and speed. The second technique is a general recursive bucketing-based scheme that can use the Aingworth-Motwani-Oldham aggregation algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulation and possibly others as the base-case subroutine. This scheme enables robust trade-offs between accuracy and time over subtrees of different sizes. For long-term options or high frequency price averaging, it can price single-stock options with smaller errors in less time than the base-case algorithms themselves. The third technique combines Fast Fourier Transform with bucketing-based schemes for pricing basket options. This technique takes polynomial time in the number of days and the number of stocks, and does not add any errors to those already incurred in the companion bucketing scheme. This technique assumes that the price of each underlying stock moves independently.','2001-02-02T20:52:36Z');

This makes it possible, for example, to decide if a certain study is feasible with a certain computing budget, and how to invest that budget. The main ingredients of the prediction are knowledge about the parallel implementation of the micro-simulation, knowledge about the characteristics of the partitioning of the transportation network graph, and knowledge about the interaction of these quantities with the computer system.

Their model assumed a directed random motion for the returns and consequently a lognormal distribution of asset prices after a finite time. We point out two problems with their formulation. First, we show that the option valuation is not uniquely determined; in particular, stratergies based on the delta-hedge and CAMP (Capital Asset Pricing Model) are shown to provide different valuations of an option. Second, asset returns are known not to be Gaussian distributed. Empirically, distributions of returns are seen to be much better approximated by an exponential distribution. This exponential distribution of asset prices can be used to develop a new pricing model for options that is shown to provide valuations that agree very well with those used by traders. We show how the Fokker-Planck formulation of fluctuations (i.e., the dynamics of the distribution) can be modified to provide an exponential distribution for returns. We also show how a singular volatility can be used to go smoothly from exponential to Gaussian returns and thereby illustrate why exponential returns cannot be reached perturbatively starting from Gaussian ones, and explain how the theory of ''stochastic volatility'' can be obtained from our model by making a bad approximation. Finally, we show how to calculate put and call prices for a stretched exponential density.','2002-01-29T18:03:39Z');

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('cs/0304009v1','Stochastic Volatility in a Quantitative Model of Stock Market Returns','Standard quantitative models of the stock market predict a log-normal distribution for stock returns (Bachelier 1900, Osborne 1959), but it is recognised (Fama 1965) that empirical data, in comparison with a Gaussian, exhibit leptokurtosis (it has more probability mass in its tails and centre) and fat tails (probabilities of extreme events are underestimated). Different attempts to explain this departure from normality have coexisted. In particular, since one of the strong assumptions of the Gaussian model concerns the volatility, considered finite and constant, the new models were built on a non finite (Mandelbrot 1963) or non constant (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross 1985) volatility. We investigate in this thesis a very recent model (Dragulescu et al. 2002) based on a Brownian motion process for the returns, and a stochastic mean-reverting process for the volatility. In this model, the forward Kolmogorov equation that governs the time evolution of returns is solved analytically. We test this new theory against different stock indexes (Dow Jones Industrial Average, Standard and Poor s and Footsie), over different periods (from 20 to 105 years). Our aim is to compare this model with the classical Gaussian and with a simple Neural Network, used as a benchmark. We perform the usual statistical tests on the kurtosis and tails of the expected distributions, paying particular attention to the outliers. As claimed by the authors, the new model outperforms the Gaussian for any time lag, but is artificially too complex for medium and low frequencies, where the Gaussian is preferable. Moreover this model is still rejected for high frequencies, at a 0.05 level of significance, due to the kurtosis, incorrectly handled.','2003-04-07T17:37:55Z');

Specifically, network theory does not seem to have enough flexibility to represent higher order aggregations, where several agents interact as a group, rather than as a collection of pairs. The model we present here uses a well established mathematical theory, the theory of simplicial complexes, to address this complex issue prevalent in interpersonal and intergroup communication. The theory enables us to provide a richer graphical representation of social interactions, and to determine quantitative mechanisms to describe the robustness of a social structure. We also propose a methodology to create random simplicial complexes, with the purpose of providing a new method to simulate computationally the creation and disgregation of social structures. Finally, we propose several measures which could be taken and observed in order to describe and study an actual social aggregation occurring in interpersonal and intergroup contexts.','2006-04-23T19:28:07Z');

Exploiting the limited context on which most binding and modification events are conditioned, attempts have been made to reduce the combinatorial complexity by quotienting the reachable set of molecular species, into species aggregates while preserving the deterministic semantics of the thermodynamic limit. Recently we proposed a quotienting that also preserves the stochastic semantics and that is complete in the sense that the semantics of individual species can be recovered from the aggregate semantics.

By considering the high drilling cost and the potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an important issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most suitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory based upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which is a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful derivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the optimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive penalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints. (2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into CMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the number of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several examples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm incorporating the Genocop III technique.

Such materials occur e.g. in historic buildings, and the durability assessment of these therefore needs a reliable and probabilistic simulation of transport processes, which is related to the suitable identification of material parameters. In order to include expert knowledge as well as experimental results, one can employ an updating procedure such as Bayesian inference. The classical probabilistic setting of the identification process in Bayes''s form requires the solution of a stochastic forward problem via computationally expensive sampling techniques, which makes the method almost impractical. In this paper novel stochastic computational techniques such as the stochastic Galerkin method are applied in order to accelerate the updating procedure. The idea is to replace the computationally expensive forward simulation via the conventional finite element (FE) method by the evaluation of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). Such an approximation of the FE model for the forward simulation perfectly suits the Bayesian updating.

In such systems an analytical Bayesian formulation might not be available in an analytic form; therefore this leads to the use of numerical methods, i.e. sampling methods. The main challenge then is to determine an efficient sampling of the model parameter space. In this paper, three sampling techniques, the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, Slice Sampling and the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) technique, are tested by updating a structural beam model. The efficiency and limitations of each technique is investigated when the FEM updating problem is implemented using the Bayesian Approach. Both MH and HMC techniques are found to perform better than the Slice sampling when Young''s modulus is chosen as the updating parameter.

In this paper, we present a new approach to handle geological uncertainty for the well placement problem with a reduced number of reservoir simulations.

We use thus only one single reservoir simulation performed on a randomly chosen realization together with the neighborhood to estimate the objective function instead of using multiple simulations on multiple realizations. This approach is combined with the stochastic optimizer CMA-ES. The proposed approach is shown on the benchmark reservoir case PUNQ-S3 to be able to capture the geological uncertainty using a smaller number of reservoir simulations.

A popular strategy of localization is to use the measured differences in arrival times of source signals at multiple pairs of receivers. In the literature, most algorithms that are based on time differences of arrival (TDOA) assume that the propagation velocity is a constant as a function of the source position, which is valid for air propagation or even for narrow band signals. However a bounded medium such as a concrete slab (encountered in indoor environement) is usually dispersive and damped. In this study, we demonstrate that under such conditions, the concrete slab can be assimilated to a thin plate; considering a Kelvin-Voigt damping model, we introduce the notion of {\em perceived propagation velocity}, which decreases when the source-sensor distance increases. This peculiar behaviour precludes any possibility to rely on existing localization methods in indoor environment. Therefore, a new localization algorithm that is adapted to a damped and dispersive medium is proposed, using only on the sign of the measured TDOA (SO-TDOA). A simulation and some experimental results are included, to define the performance of this SO-TDOA algorithm.','2012-11-14T08:21:06Z');

Here we consider the problems of sampling and counting the most parsimonious SCJ scenarios. We show that both the sampling and counting problems are easy for two genomes, and we relate SCJ scenarios to alternating permutations. However, for an arbitrary number of genomes related by a binary phylogenetic tree, the counting and sampling problems become hard. We prove that if a Fully Polynomial Randomized Approximation Scheme or a Fully Polynomial Almost Uniform Sampler exist for the most parsimonious SCJ scenario, then RP = NP.   The proof has a wider scope than genome rearrangements: the same result holds for parsimonious evolutionary scenarios on any set of discrete characters.','2013-04-08T11:22:12Z');

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a signal in pharmacovigilance as "any reported information on a possible causal relationship between an adverse event and a drug, the relationship being unknown or incompletely documented previously". For spontaneous reporting systems, many machine learning methods are used to detect ADRs, such as Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN), decision support methods, genetic algorithms, knowledge based approaches, etc. One limitation is the reporting mechanism to submit ADR reports, which has serious underreporting and is not able to accurately quantify the corresponding risk.

Suitable values for the regularization parameter are successfully determined in both cases for synthetic but practically relevant examples. Whenever the geologic situation permits, it is easier and more efficient to model the subsurface with a 2-D algorithm, rather than to apply a full 3-D approach.

The types of activations were forcast using a table of probabilities for events, typed by duration and volume of ejecta. Lengths of time were represented by the number of activations to expect within a given time-frame, calculated assuming Poisson-distributed inter-arrival times for activations.

One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this technology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and efficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite identification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a reference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match. However the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in computational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical structures.   This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS fragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM), and a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from MS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction task (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a putative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a target MS/MS spectrum).   In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved performance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to substructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM obtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing methods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying PubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.','2013-12-01T19:20:57Z');

Finite element simulation was complemented with series of limit equilibrium analyses. Stability analyses have shown that slope failure occurs with the development of a circular slip surface located in the soft clay layer. Both models (FEM and LEM) confirm that the least stable hydraulic condition is the combination of the minimum river levels at low tide with the maximal saturation of soil layers. FEM results indicate that in winter time the levee is almost at its limit state, at the margin of safety (strength reduction factor values are 1.03 and 1.04 for the low-tide and high-tide phases, respectively); these results agree with real-life observations.

We propose a method to accelerate and improve read mapping based on an initial clustering of possibly billions of high-throughput sequencing reads, yielding clusters of high stringency and a high degree of overlap. This clustering improves on the state-of-the-art in running time for small datasets and, for the first time, makes clustering high-coverage human libraries feasible. Given the efficiently computed clusters, only one representative read from each cluster needs to be mapped using a traditional readmapper such as BWA, instead of individually mapping all reads. On human reads, all processing steps, including clustering and mapping, only require 11%-59% of the time for individually mapping all reads, achieving speed-ups for all readmappers, while minimally affecting mapping quality. This accelerates a highly sensitive readmapper such as Stampy to be competitive with a fast readmapper such as BWA on unclustered reads.','2014-04-10T16:29:09Z');

Thus, there have been many paradigms developed to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious combinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of $k$ to vary; having a larger value of $k$ where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of $k$ where the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One open problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the value of $k$ prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values of $k$ can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in a phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple values of $k$ practical for genome assembly.   Results: We present HyDA-Vista, which is a genome assembler that uses homology information to choose a value of $k$ for each read prior to the de Bruijn graph construction. The chosen $k$ is optimal if there are no sequencing errors and the coverage is sufficient. Fundamental to our method is the construction of the {\em maximal sequence landscape}, which is a data structure that stores for each position in the input string, the largest repeated substring containing that position. In particular, we show the maximal sequence landscape can be constructed in $O(n + n \log n)$-time and $O(n)$-space. HyDA-Vista first constructs the maximal sequence landscape for a homologous genome. The reads are then aligned to this reference genome, and values of $k$ are assigned to each read using the maximal sequence landscape and the alignments. Eventually, all the reads are assembled by an iterative de Bruijn graph construction method. Our results and comparison to other assemblers demonstrate that HyDA-Vista achieves the best assembly of {\em E. coli} before repeat resolution or scaffolding.','2014-08-24T11:26:37Z');

Nodal Lagrange multipliers enforce the compatibility of independent layers in this approach. We have derived the discretized model by the energy-minimization arguments, assuming that the unknown fields are approximated by bi-linear functions at the element level, and solved the resulting system by the Newton method with consistent linearization. We have demonstrated through verification and validation examples that the proposed formulation is reliable and accurately reproduces the behavior of laminated glass units. This study represents a first step to the development of a comprehensive, mechanics-based model for laminated glass systems that is suitable for implementation in common engineering finite element solvers.','2014-10-31T09:00:37Z');

Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often does not protect against knee OA development. Accordingly, a multiscale formulation for Data Driven Prognosis (DDP) of post ACLR is developed. Unlike traditional predictive strategies that require controlled off-line measurements or training for determination of constitutive parameters to derive the transitional statistics, the proposed DDP algorithm relies solely on in situ measurements. The proposed DDP scheme is capable of predicting onset of instabilities. Since the need for off line testing (or training) is obviated, it can be easily implemented for ACLR, where such controlled a priori testing is almost impossible to conduct. The DDP algorithm facilitates hierarchical handling of the large data set, and can assess the state of recovery in post ACLR conditions based on data collected from stair ascent and descent exercises of subjects. The DDP algorithm identifies inefficient knee varus motion and knee rotation as primary difficulties experienced by some of the post ACLR population. In such cases, levels of energy dissipation rate at the knee, and its fluctuation may be used as measures for assessing progress after ACL reconstruction.','2014-10-30T22:54:07Z');

Our aim is to find out the best infrastructure development from among three choices being considered by the local government for the purpose of solving the traffic problems in the area.

Based on these models, we then simulated the effect of the proposed infrastructure developments on~$\Delta$ and~$\Sigma$ and used these metrics as our basis of comparison. We found out that the proposed widening of one fork from two lanes to three lanes has the most improved metrics at the same $\alpha=0.05$ compared to the metrics we observed in the current situation.

INSERT INTO Paper VALUES('1506.08231v3','A zero-sum monetary system, interest rates, and implications','To the knowledge of the author, this is the first time it has been shown that interest rates that are extremely high by modern standards (100% and higher) are necessary within a zero-sum monetary system, and not just driven by greed. Extreme interest rates that appeared in various places and times reinforce the idea that hard money may have contributed to high rates of interest. Here a model is presented that examines the interest rate required to succeed as an investor in a zero-sum fixed quantity hard-money system. Even when the playing field is significantly tilted toward the investor, interest rates need to be much higher than expected. In a completely fair zero-sum system, an investor cannot break even without charging 100% interest. Even with a 5% advantage, an investor won''t break even at 15% interest. From this it is concluded that what we consider usurious rates today are, within a hard-money system, driven by necessity.   Cryptocurrency is a novel form of hard-currency. The inability to virtualize the money creates a system close to zero-sum because of the limited supply design. Therefore, within the bounds of a cryptocurrency system that limits money creation, interest rates must rise to levels that the modern world considers usury. It is impossible, therefore, that a cryptocurrency that is not expandable could take over a modern economy and replace modern fiat currency.','2015-06-26T22:23:22Z');

Ultrafast Shape Recognition (USR) is a popular approach of this type. It uses vectors of 12 real number as 3 first moments of distances from 4 emphasized points.

In practice, the inadequate model may be the best that is available or tractable, and so despite its inadequacy the model may be used to make predictions of unobserved quantities. In this case, a representation of the inadequacy is necessary, so the impact of the observed discrepancy can be determined. We investigate this problem in the context of chemical kinetics and propose a new technique to account for model inadequacy that is both probabilistic and physically meaningful. A stochastic inadequacy operator $\mathcal{S}$ is introduced which is embedded in the ODEs describing the evolution of chemical species concentrations and which respects certain physical constraints such as conservation laws.

Our contention is that, given a fixed number of variables, one of them being historic volatility of NIFTY returns, if increase in the number of clusters improves clustering efficiency, then volatility cannot be predicted. Volatility then becomes random as, for a given time period, it gets classified in various clusters.

Indeed if we can hit upon, in a sense, an optimum number of variables, then if the number of clusters is reasonably small, we can use these variables to predict volatility.

ExTASY provides Python based "templated scripts" that interface to an interoperable and high-performance pilot-based run time system, which abstracts the complexity of managing multiple simulations. ExTASY supports the use of existing highly-optimised parallel MD code and their coupling to analysis tools based upon collective coordinates which do not require a priori knowledge of the system to bias.

One of the workflows leverages the Locally Scaled Diffusion Maps technique; the other makes use of Complementary Coordinates techniques to enhance sampling and generate start-points for the next generation of MD simulations. We show that the ExTASY tools have been deployed on a range of HPC systems including ARCHER (Cray CX30), Blue Waters (Cray XE6/XK7), and Stampede (Linux cluster), and that good strong scaling can be obtained up to 1000s of MD simulations, independent of the size of each simulation.

Despite its simplicity, whenever the template structure has large structural noise, the eigenvalues of the estimated tensor have a magnitude systematically smaller than their actual values. This leads to systematic error when calculating the eigenvalue dependent parameters, magnitude and rhombicity. We propose here a Monte Carlo simulation method to remove such bias. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the setting when the eigenvalue estimates from multiple template protein fragments are available and their average is used as an improved eigenvalue estimator.

On the other hand, point contact formulations serve as sufficiently accurate and very efficient models in the regime of large contact angles, while they are not applicable for small contact angles as a consequence of non-unique closest point projections. In order to combine the advantages of these basic formulations, a novel all-angle beam contact (ABC) formulation is developed that applies a point contact formulation for large contact angles and a recently developed line contact formulation for small contact angles, the two being smoothly connected by means of a variationally consistent model transition. Based on a stringent analysis, two different transition laws are investigated, optimal algorithmic parameters are suggested and conservation of energy and momentum is shown. All configuration-dependent quantities are consistently linearized, thus allowing for their application within implicit time integration schemes. Furthermore, a step size control of the nonlinear solution scheme that allows for large displacement increments per time step and an efficient two-stage contact search based on dynamically adapted search segments are proposed. A series of numerical test cases is analyzed in order to verify the accuracy and consistency of the proposed contact model transition regarding contact force distributions and conservation properties, but also for quantifying the efficiency gains as compared to standard beam contact formulations.','2016-07-29T15:45:42Z');

The resulting algorithm has been implemented in PHG, and is used for ordering elements in the coarsest mesh for the refinement tree mesh partitioning algorithm.   2) We designed encoding and decoding algorithms for high dimensional Hilbert order. Hilbert order has good locality, and it has wide applications in various fields in computer science, such as memory management, database, and dynamic load balancing.   3) We implemented refinement tree and space filling curve based mesh partitioning algorithms in PHG, and designed the dynamic load balancing module of PHG. The refinement tree based partitioning algorithm was originally proposed by Mitchell, the one implemented in PHG was improved in several aspects. The space filling curve based mesh partitioning function in PHG can use either Hilbert or Morton space filling curve.   4) We studied existing hp-adaptive strategies in the literature, and proposed a new strategy.

This paper presents a robust, scalable numerical formulation based on variational inequalities (VI), to model non-linear flows through heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media without violating DMP. VI is an optimization technique that places bounds on the numerical solutions of partial differential equations. To crystallize the ideas, a modification to Darcy equations by taking into account pressure-dependent viscosity will be discretized using the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas (RT0) and Variational Multi-scale (VMS) finite element formulations.

The Weibull distribution shows the best results for the extreme values of the wind speed. Conclusions. The results of the analysis are consistent with the common practice of using the Weibull distribution for wind speed modeling.

NEAMS embraces a multiresolution hierarchy designing the code suite structure to ultimately span the full range of length and time scales present in relevant reactor design and safety analyses. Advanced reactors, such as liquid metal reactors, rely on innovative component designs to meet cost and safety targets. In order to span a wider design range, advanced modeling and simulation capabilities that rely on minimal assumptions play an important role in optimizing the design. Over the past several years the NEAMS program has developed the integrated multiphysics code suite (thermal-hydraulics, structural analysis and neutronics) SHARP aimed at streamlining the prototyping of such components. For the simulation of fluid flow and heat transfer, SHARP focuses on the high-fidelity end, aiming primarily at turbulence-resolving techniques such large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulation (DNS). The computational fluid dynamics code (CFD) selected for SHARP is Nek5000, a state-of-the-art highly scalable tool employing the spectral element method (SEM). In this manuscript, to be published in a Von karman institute lecture series monograph on liquid metal reactors, we review the method and its implementation in Nek5000. We also examine several applications. We note that Nek5000 is also regularly employed for intermediate-fidelity approaches such as Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and for reduced-order models employing momentum sources or porous media, especially when coupled to neutronics modeling.','2017-11-25T23:29:43Z');

Utilizing the finite element analysis yields two models in order to predict the performance of each component. The first model is a beam structure with a rapid response in structural stiffness simulation. This model is used for performing the static tests including modal frequency, bending stiffens and torsional stiffness evaluation.

In order to perform the crashworthiness analysis, the explicit nonlinear dynamic solver provided by ABAQUS, a commercial finite element software, is used. The results of finite element beam and shell models are in line with the concept design specifications.

Load forecasting matters to the effective operation of power system. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework to forecast the short-term grid load. First, the load data is processed by Box-Cox transformation, and two parameters (electricity price and temperature) are investigated. Then, to quantify the tail-dependence of power load on the two parameters, parametric Copula models are fitted and the threshold of peak load are computed. Next, a deep belief network is built to forecast the hourly load of the power grid. One year grid load data collected from an urbanized area in Texas, United States is utilized in the case studies. Short-term load forecasting are examined in four seasons independently. Day-ahead and week-ahead load forecasting experiments are conducted in each season using the proposed framework. The proposed framework is compared with classical neural networks, support vector regression machine, extreme learning machine, and classical deep belief networks. The load forecasting performances are assessed by mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and hit rate. Computational results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven deep learning framework. The prediction accuracies of both day-ahead forecasting and week-ahead forecasting demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the tested algorithms.','2017-11-30T17:12:54Z');

From the spatiotemporal behaviour of the error, the SPH pressure jump is likened to entropy errors observed for artificial viscosity based finite difference/volume schemes. The error is observed to be generated at start-up and dissipation is the only recourse to mitigate it''s effect. We show that similar errors are generated for the Lagrangian plus remap version of the Piecewise Parabolic Method (PPM) finite volume code (PPMLR). Through a comparison with the direct Eulerian version of the PPM code (PPMDE), we argue that a lack of diffusion across the material wave (contact discontinuity) is responsible for the error in PPMLR. We verify this hypothesis by constructing a more dissipative version of the remap code using a piecewise constant reconstruction. As an application to SPH, we propose a hybrid GSPH scheme that adds the requisite dissipation by utilizing a more dissipative Riemann solver for the energy equation. The proposed modification to the GSPH scheme, and it''s improved treatment of the anomaly is verified for flows with strong shocks in one and two dimensions. The result that dissipation must act across the density and energy equations provides a consistent explanation for many of the hitherto proposed "cures" or "fixes" for the problem.','2013-11-09T12:59:38Z');

Two different rotation interpolation schemes with strong or weak Kirchhoff constraint enforcement, respectively, as well as two different choices of nodal triad parametrizations in terms of rotation or tangent vectors are proposed. The combination of these schemes leads to four novel finite element variants, all of them based on a C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam centerline. Essential requirements such as representability of general 3D, large-deformation, dynamic problems involving slender beams with arbitrary initial curvatures and anisotropic cross-section shapes or preservation of objectivity and path-independence will be investigated analytically and verified numerically for the different formulations. It will be shown that the geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam elements proposed in this work are the first ones of this type that fulfill all the considered requirements. On the contrary, Simo-Reissner type formulations fulfilling these requirements can be found in the literature very well. However, it will be argued that the shear-free Kirchhoff-Love formulations can provide considerable numerical advantages when applied to highly slender beams.

A geometric predicate usually consists of evaluating the sign of some algebraic expression. In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable result, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate the algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if the exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some (small) varepsilon, which represents the largest error that may arise in the evaluation of the expression. The threshold varepsilon depends on the structure of the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the input operands are error-free.   A pair (arithmetic engine,threshold) is an "arithmetic filter". In this paper we develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic filter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the probability of failure of the filter.   To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be chosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze the two important predicates "which-side" and "insphere". We show that the probability that the absolute values of the corresponding determinants be no larger than some positive value V, with emphasis on small V, is Theta(V) for the which-side predicate, while for the insphere predicate it is Theta(V^(2/3)) in dimension 1, O(sqrt(V)) in dimension 2, and O(sqrt(V) ln(1/V)) in higher dimensions.

Our work consists of two main parts. In the first, we address problems and measures that relate to collections of orthogonal line segments in the plane. Such collections arise naturally from problems in mapping buildings and robot exploration.   We propose a new measure of segment similarity called a \emph{coverage measure}, and present efficient algorithms for maximising this measure between sets of axis-parallel segments under translations. Our algorithms run in time $O(n^3\polylog n)$ in the general case, and run in time $O(n^2\polylog n)$ for the case when all segments are horizontal. In addition, we show that when restricted to translations that are only vertical, the Hausdorff distance between two sets of horizontal segments can be computed in time roughly $O(n^{3/2}{\sl polylog}n)$. These algorithms form significant improvements over the general algorithm of Chew et al. that takes time $O(n^4 \log^2 n)$. In the second part of this paper we address the problem of matching polygonal chains. We study the well known \Frd, and present the first algorithm for computing the \Frd under general translations.

We show that such a set of independent points can be constructed efficiently in parallel and that the number of iterations needed is $O(\log^2(L/s))$, where $L$ is the diameter of the domain, and $s$ is the smallest edge in the output mesh. In addition, we show that the insertion of each independent set of points can be realized sequentially by Ruppert''s method in two dimensions and Shewchuk''s in three dimensions. Therefore, our parallel Delaunay refinement methods provide the same element quality and mesh size guarantees as the sequential algorithms in both two and three dimensions.

If we impose some of the constraints that are imposed by the manufacturing process, we obtain quite different results.

The problem is rich even for partitioning regular polygons into convex pieces, the focus of this paper. We show that the optimal (most circular) partition for an equilateral triangle has an infinite number of pieces, with the lower bound approachable to any accuracy desired by a particular finite partition.

We present algorithms that work for a large family of shapes, provided either only translations and no rotations are allowed, or only rotation about a fixed point is allowed; that is, one is allowed to only scale and translate a given shape, or scale and rotate the shape around a fixed point. Our algorithms start with a polytope guessed to be of optimal size and iteratively moves it based on a greedy principle: simply move the current polytope directly towards any outside point till it touches the surface. For computing the minimum enclosing ball, this gives a simple greedy algorithm with running time $O(nd/\eps)$ producing a ball of radius $1+\eps$ times the optimal. This simple principle generalizes to arbitrary convex shape when only translations are allowed, requiring at most $O(1/\eps^2)$ iterations. Our algorithm implies that {\em core-sets} of size $O(1/\eps^2)$ exist not only for minimum enclosing ball but also for any convex shape with a fixed orientation.

When comparing measured data to data drawn from a baseline distribution, merely, finding clusters in the measured data may not actually represent true anomalies. These clusters may likely be the clusters of the baseline distribution. Hence, a discrepancy function is often used to examine how different measured data is to baseline data within a region. An anomalous region is thus defined to be one with high discrepancy.   In this paper, we present algorithms for maximizing statistical discrepancy functions over the space of axis-parallel rectangles. We give provable approximation guarantees, both additive and relative, and our methods apply to any convex discrepancy function. Our algorithms work by connecting statistical discrepancy to combinatorial discrepancy; roughly speaking, we show that in order to maximize a convex discrepancy function over a class of shapes, one needs only maximize a linear discrepancy function over the same set of shapes.   We derive general discrepancy functions for data generated from a one- parameter exponential family. This generalizes the widely-used Kulldorff scan statistic for data from a Poisson distribution.

Previously, only obtuse triangles were known to admit locked shapes, and only line segments were known to guarantee universal foldability. We show that a surprisingly general family of planar shapes, called slender adornments, guarantees universal foldability: roughly, the distance from each edge along the path along the boundary of the slender adornment to each hinge should be monotone.

A function $\phi$, proportional to the logarithm of the cell size, is shown to obey the Poisson equation, with localized charges corresponding to irregular vertices. The problem of finding a suitable manifold for a given domain is thus shown to exactly reduce to an Inverse Poisson problem on $\phi$, of finding a distribution of localized charges adhering to the conditions derived for boundary alignment.
